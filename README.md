LocalHUNT - beta
=========
##Visit [LocalHUNT](http://tinylandmarks.herokuapp.com/ "LocalHUNT") on Heroku!!
LocalHUNT facilitates urban exploration. When I first moved to San Francsico I walked as much as the city
as possible in order to get a feel for its unique feel. I found incredible views, abandoned turrets, unseen graffiti and amazing beaches. I wanted to build something for those of us who would rather turn a stroll into an expedition.

###Technologies
This is a javascript on sinatra app. The majority of the funcitonality is created with MVC vanilla javascript.
I needed sinatra to build out a persistence layer so I could store data.

- javascript
- sinatra framework
- ruby
- jquery
- googlemaps API
- event driven programming
- MVC architecture
- Heroku
- postgreSQL
- HTML5 geolocation

####COOL PARTS
